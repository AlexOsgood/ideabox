The purpose of this project is to make a website where you can make your own idea tiles with a title and body of your choosing. You should be able favorite tiles (showing a red star) and you should be able to delete stored tiles.

Instructions:
1. Have some ideas!
2. Clone this repo down to your machine.
3. cd into the directory.
4. Run open index.html to view in browser.
5. Make your idea cards! Favorite the good ones, delete the bad ones!

Our group found that the best way to work on this project for us was to have one person share their screen while the rest of us navigated. Thomas ended up being the one who shared his screen most often so he made most of the commits. We were all involved in writing the code.
We have a testing mode where we unhide our "title card" exemplar and test functionality on it. We were able to get tiles to appear based on user input. We were able to update the data model showing that we had favorited a specific idea card. We were not able to show that in the DOM, in spite of being able to get it to update in our testing mode. We had difficulty with our svgs appearing properly in the CSS. The colours of the nearby elements were bleeding onto the X svg.
